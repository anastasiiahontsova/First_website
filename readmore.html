    The goal of Műhely is to present progressive Hungarian cuisine which is based on the intertwining of art, science and gastronomy and that uses local ingredients. In addition to the experimental kitchen, Műhely also includes a gastronomy library and an open view ceramics workshop, which both play an important role in our efforts to develop the talents of the new generation of culinary and design professionals. Our guests will be able to sit at a big communal table that seats 16 people. After the opening of ONYX, Műhely will continue to remain a space for research and development and innovation, where guests will be able to see behind the scenes of the work processes. Once the ONYX Creative Community deems a dish to be finished work, it will move up to the ONYX menu, while the prototype will be taken off the menu at Műhely to make room for a new, experimental dish.
