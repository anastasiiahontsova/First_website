                        Műhely is the creative space of the ONYX Creative Community. This is where we showcase the dishes which are still in an experimental phase and that will eventually be served at ONYX. Guests will not only be able to witness the experimentation process, but also be able to become a part of it and help us develop the dishes and serveware. They will have the opportunity to get to know us and peek behind the scenes and we will use their feedback to perfect our dishes.
